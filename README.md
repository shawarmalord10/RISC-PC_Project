# RISC-PC_Project
This repository contains the Verilog HDL implementation of a 5-stage pipelined Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor. This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of CPU design, including instruction fetching, decoding, execution, memory access, and write-back stages. The processor is designed to execute a subset of common RISC instructions, providing a foundational understanding of processor architecture.  
The attached report pdf has detailed breakdown of individual modules and stage-by-stage waveform analysis.  

This project was developed as a group assignment for the Computer Architecture (CS F421) course at my college.
